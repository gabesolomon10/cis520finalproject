\f0\fs24 \cf0 Approaches:\
(1) Cluster counties based on outcomes\
	- Also captures similarity between diseases\
(2) Cluster based on predictors\
	- Probably PCA/CCA\
	- Some type of prediction on clusters (weighted average)\
(3) Do PCA/CCA/Elastic Net --> run regressions on this\
	- RF\
	- Boosting\
	- Logistic Regression\
	- SVM\
	- NN\
(4) Run Regression based on raw features\
	- \
(5) Cluster Tweets based on \
	- GMM\
	- PCA\
	- CCA\
	- Other Variance clustering measure\
(6) MTL algorithms\
\
Other questions:\
- How do we regularize parameters in a clever way here or adopt a clever kernel?\
	- Down-weight things that are similar (maybe have higher kernel) in regression\
	- Up-weight things we now are important\
		- Education, etc. \
	- Proportinal weightings on PC's to their variance explained\
	- Kernel between \
